/**
 * An interface for the game logic of a variation of the popular card game
 * "rummy". Together with the unit tests <code>TestRummyCode</code>, an
 * implementation of this interface is meant to be an exercise in
 * object-oriented development. An implementation of this type should provide a
 * constructor with the signature <code>Rummy(String... players)</code> where
 * the elements of <code>players</code> are the names of the players.
 * <p>
 * The expected behavior of an implementation is outlined in the unit tests that
 * have been provided. The methods of this interface are only concerned with
 * gameplay. There are no methods for dealing with scores. The first player to
 * discard their hand, consistent with the rules, wins the game. The possible
 * states of the game depend on the current player and the various phases of the
 * play as described in the enum <code>Steps</code>.
 * <p>
 * Improper uses for this type are intended to be handled with unchecked
 * exceptions as described in <code>RummyException</code>.
 * <p>
 * The accompanying unit tests assume certain conventions. A <b>non-standard</b>
 * deck of 65 playing cards with 5 suits and 13 ranks is assumed. The 5 suits
 * are Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, and Moons. Individual cards are
 * referenced by short 2-3 character strings. The first group of characters
 * indicates rank while the last group indicates the suit. For example, the
 * string <code>"3D"</code> would represent the 3 of Diamonds. The string
 * <code>"10C"</code> represents the 10 of Clubs. The regular expression
 * <code>"(A|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|J|Q|K)(C|D|H|S|M)"</code> defines valid card
 * descriptions. To give some more examples, <code>"AM"</code> represents the
 * Ace of Moons, <code>"2D"</code> represents the Two of Diamonds,
 * <code>"QH"</code> represents the Queen of Hearts. When forming runs, an Ace
 * can be treated as high or low. For example, <code>AC,2C,3C</code> and
 * <code>JC,QC,KC,AC</code> are both to be understood as valid runs.
 * <p>
 * The order of the players should be consistent with the order seen in the
 * array returned from <code>getPlayers()</code>. The first element of the array
 * is the name of the first player, second of the second player and so on. Play
 * progresses and cards are dealt in the corresponding order. Play always begins
 * with the first player.
 * <p>
 * A newly instantiated instance of this type should always be in the WAITING
 * step. The methods <code>rearrange</code> and <code>shuffle</code> are meant
 * to allow the client to put the deck into a certain state before play begins.
 * The method <code>initialDeal</code> deals cards to the players and moves the
 * game to the first turn of the first player in the DRAW step. Play continues
 * until a player discards or melds all of their cards. The game should go to
 * the FINISHED step when that happens.
